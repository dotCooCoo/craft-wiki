This page lists every setting in the Preferences dialog, page by page, with its default and its range or choices. It also describes how **Reset Preferences** works.

## Open Preferences

1. On Windows and Linux, choose **Edit → Preferences…** (**Ctrl+K**). On macOS, choose **VectorCraft → Settings → General…** (**Cmd+K**), or another page in the same submenu. **Cmd+,** also opens Preferences on macOS.
2. Click a page in the dialog's page list, or click **Next** and **Previous** to move through the pages. The dialog opens on **General**, or on macOS on the page you chose.
3. Change the settings. Fields that hold a length show it in the unit set on the **Units** page of the dialog, and they switch to a new unit as soon as you pick it there.
4. Click **OK** to apply the changes, or **Cancel** to close the dialog without changing anything.

![The Edit menu open over a harbor scene at dusk, with Preferences… highlighted at the bottom of the menu next to its shortcut Ctrl+K](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/preferences-edit-menu.webp)

The pages are General, Selection & Anchor Display, Type, Units, Guides & Grid, Smart Guides, Slices, Hyphenation, Plug-ins & Scratch Disks, User Interface, Performance, File Handling, Clipboard Handling, Appearance of Black and Devices.

![The Preferences dialog open on the General page over a harbor illustration, with the page list on the left, Keyboard Increment 1 pt, Constrain Angle 0°, Corner Radius 12 pt and Paste Offset 10 pt, and Reset Preferences, Previous, Next, Cancel and OK along the bottom](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/preferences-dialog-window.webp)

Some settings depend on others or on the platform:

- **Numbers Without Units Are Points** is dimmed unless one of the Units settings is Picas.
- **Animated Zoom** is dimmed while **GPU Performance** is off.
- **Accent Color** is dimmed while **Color Scheme** is Classic.
- **System Title Bar** appears on Windows and Linux only, and **Linux Display Server** appears on Linux only.
- **System Title Bar**, **Graphics Processor** and **Linux Display Server** take effect the next time VectorCraft starts.

In the tables, a checkbox shows On or Off as its default. Lengths are listed in points, the default unit.

![The General page scrolled to its last options, with New Art Has Basic Appearance turned on under Appearance Panel, and Single Corner Radius on and Transform set to Default under Transform Panel](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/preferences-general-panels.webp)

- **Keyboard Increment** is the distance an arrow key moves the selection. With Shift, an arrow key moves it ten times as far. The arrow keys move along the axes that **Constrain Angle** sets.
- **Constrain Angle** sets the angle that Shift-constrained drags start from. Shift limits a drag to 45° steps from that angle.
- **Corner Radius** is the corner radius of the Rounded Rectangle tool.
- **Paste Offset** is how far VectorCraft offsets pasted and duplicated objects.
- While **Disable Auto Add/Delete** is off, the Pen tool adds an anchor when you click a segment of a selected path, and deletes an anchor when you click one.
- **Use Precise Cursors** shows the drawing tools' pointers as crosshairs. Caps Lock does the same while it is on.
- When **Show Tool Tips** is off, no button or field shows a tool tip.
- **Use Preview Bounds** makes the bounding box measure the visible bounds of the artwork, strokes included.
- **Double Click To Isolate** lets a double-click on a group with the Selection tool isolate the group.
- **Scrub Numeric Fields by Dragging** lets you change a numeric field's value by dragging left or right on the field or its label.
- **Trackpad Gesture to Rotate View** turns the view around the pointer when you rotate two fingers on a Mac trackpad. The view starts to turn once the gesture reaches 5°.
- **Use Japanese Crop Marks** sets the style of the marks that **Object → Create Trim Marks** and **Effect → Crop Marks** draw.
- While **New Art Has Basic Appearance** is on, new art gets one fill and one stroke. While it is off, new art takes the whole appearance of the last selection.
- **Constrain Width and Height Proportions** is the link between W and H in the Transform panel, the Properties panel and the Control bar.
- While **Single Corner Radius** is on, one Corner Radius field sets every corner of a live rectangle. While it is off, each corner has its own field.
- **Transform** sets what the Transform panel transforms: the object, its pattern, or both. **Default** follows **Transform Pattern Tiles**.
- **Use Registration Point for Symbol** makes the Transform panel measure and transform a single selected symbol instance from its symbol's registration point instead of the reference point.

## Selection & Anchor Display

| Setting | Default | Range or choices |
|---|---|---|
| **Tolerance** | 3 px | 1 to 8 px |

![The Selection & Anchor Display page with Tolerance 3 px, Snap to Point 2 px, the anchor Size slider at 3, Handles set to Solid and the corner widget angle at 177°](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/preferences-selection-anchors.webp)

- **Tolerance** is how close, in screen pixels, a click must be to a path or an anchor to select it.
- While **Object Selection by Path Only** is on, a click inside a filled path does not select it. Only a click on the path does.
- **Snap to Point** is how close, in screen pixels, an anchor or a guide must be to pull the pointer to it while **View → Snap to Point** is on.
- **Command Click to Select Objects Behind** lets a Ctrl-click (Cmd-click on macOS) with the Selection tool select the object under the selected one. The next click selects the object under that one.
- **Size** sets how large anchors and handles are drawn.
- **Highlight anchors on mouse over** marks the anchor under the pointer while you use the Direct Selection tool.
- While **Show handles when multiple anchors are selected** is off, the Direct Selection tool shows handles only while one anchor is selected.
- A corner whose angle is greater than the **Hide Corner Widget for angles greater than** value shows no Live Corners widget.
- **Enable Rubber Band for: Pen Tool** shows a preview of the next segment from the last anchor to the pointer.

![The Type page with Size/Leading 2 pt, Tracking 20 /1000 em and Baseline Shift 2 pt, both Language Options turned off, Font Preview Size set to Medium and Number of Recent Fonts set to 10](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/preferences-type-page.webp)

- **Size/Leading** and **Baseline Shift** are shown in the unit of the **Type** setting on the Units page.
- **Size/Leading**, **Tracking** and **Baseline Shift** come first, with no heading. **Show East Asian Options** and **Show Indic Options** are under **Language Options**, and the settings from **Type Object Selection by Path Only** to **Additional Fonts Folder** are under **Options**.
- While **Type Object Selection by Path Only** is on, you select type only on its type path: the baseline of point type, the frame of area type, or the path of type on a path.
- While **Highlight Substituted Fonts** is on, text drawn in a substitute for a missing font is highlighted on screen, in every document.
- While **Fill New Type Objects With Placeholder Text** is on, new type starts with placeholder text, selected.
- VectorCraft lists and uses the fonts in the **Additional Fonts Folder** and its subfolders as if they were installed. When you change the folder, the font menus update.
- While **Override Character Color** is on, a graphic style applied to type replaces the fill and stroke of its characters with the style's fills and strokes.
- The **Align to Glyph Bounds** settings make Align and Distribute measure point type, or area type, by the ink of its glyphs. Otherwise they measure point type by its em box and area type by its frame.

## Units

- **Alignment Guides** shows the lines along the edges and centers that the artwork lines up with. While it is off, the artwork still snaps into line.
- **Transform Tools** shows readouts while you scale, rotate and shear.
- While **Construction Guides** is on, guide lines run through the point you draw from at the angles that **Angles** sets. A point you draw near one of those lines lands on it.
- **Anchor/Path Labels** shows labels such as "anchor", "center" and "path". **Measurement Labels** shows size and offset readouts while you draw and move.
- While **Spacing Guides** is on, a moved selection snaps to the same gap as two other objects in its row or column, or to the middle between its two neighbors, and the equal gaps show.
- While **Invoke Distance Guides** is on, holding Alt (Option on macOS) with the Selection tool over another object shows how far the selection is from it. Over an empty part of an artboard, it shows the distance to the artboard's edges.
- **Snapping Tolerance** is how close a smart guide target must be to pull the pointer, a dragged edge or a drawn point to it.
- **Snap to Tangent** and **Snap to Perpendicular** are under **Geometric Guides**.

- VectorCraft installs the plug-ins in the **Additional Plug-ins Folder**. Type the path or click **Choose…**. The web build has no **Choose…** button. If you pick a folder that VectorCraft cannot list, the status bar shows the reason and the setting keeps its earlier value.
- When you click **OK**, VectorCraft checks a folder you typed here or in the Data Recovery **Folder** field. It does not check an empty field or a folder that the setting already holds. If VectorCraft cannot use the folder, the status bar shows the reason, no setting changes and the dialog stays open.

![The Performance page on Windows with GPU Performance and Animated Zoom turned on, Graphics Processor set to Automatic, History States 500, Real-time Drawing and Editing on and Render Threads -1](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/preferences-performance-page.webp)

- **GPU Performance**, **Animated Zoom** and **Graphics Processor** are under **GPU Performance**.
- **Graphics Processor** chooses the graphics processor VectorCraft uses on a computer that has two. The change takes effect the next time VectorCraft starts.
- **History States** is the number of undo steps each open document keeps.
- **Render Threads** is the number of threads that draw the canvas. -1 lets VectorCraft choose.
- On a Wayland session, **X11 (XWayland)** opens the window through XWayland, which lets you drop files on the window. **Automatic** and **X11 (XWayland) When a Pen Is Attached** open the window through XWayland only when a drawing tablet's pen is attached as VectorCraft starts. If a drawing tablet's pen does not draw, choose one of the X11 (XWayland) options.

For problems with the window or a drawing tablet, see [Troubleshooting](/apps/vectorcraft/troubleshooting/).

## File Handling

- The four recovery settings are under **Data Recovery**. For **Folder**, type a path or click **Choose…**. VectorCraft accepts only a folder it can list and write to.
- **Templates Folder** is the folder where **File → Save as Template…** and **File → New from Template…** start. When it is empty, they start in `Documents/VectorCraft Templates`.
- While **Use System Defaults for Edit Original** is on, **Edit Original** in the Links panel opens a linked file in the system's default app for that file. While it is off, **Edit Original** opens a raster image in PhotoCraft where PhotoCraft is installed, and otherwise in the system's default app.
- While **Mark Older Files as [Converted] When Opened** is on, a native file from an older version opens as *name* [Converted], so **Save** asks for a new name.
- While **Use Compression** is on, VectorCraft compresses `.vectorcraft` files when it saves them.

## Clipboard Handling

| Setting | Default | Range or choices |
|---|---|---|
| **Include SVG Code** | On | On or off |
| **PDF** | Off | On or off |
| **Legacy vector clipboard (no transparency)** | Off | On or off |

![The Clipboard Handling page with Include SVG Code turned on and PDF and the legacy clipboard turned off under On Copy, and When pasting text set to Keep Formatting under On Paste](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/preferences-clipboard-page.webp)

- The first four settings are under **On Copy**, and **When pasting text** is under **On Paste**.
- With **Keep Plain Text**, text you paste while typing takes the style at the text cursor.

## Appearance of Black

| Setting | Default | Range or choices |
|---|---|---|
| **On Screen** | Display All Blacks Accurately | Display All Blacks Accurately, Display All Blacks as Rich Black |
| **Printing / Exporting** | Output All Blacks Accurately | Output All Blacks Accurately, Output All Blacks as Rich Black |

![The Appearance of Black page with On Screen set to Display All Blacks Accurately and Printing / Exporting set to Output All Blacks Accurately](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/preferences-black-page.webp)

## Devices

| Setting | Default | Range or choices |
|---|---|---|
| **Enable Touch Workspace** | On | On or off |
| **Enable Touch Gestures** | On | On or off |

![The Devices page with Enable Touch Workspace and Enable Touch Gestures turned on](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/preferences-devices-page.webp)

- While **Enable Touch Workspace** is on, VectorCraft switches to the Touch workspace on a touch screen.

## Reset Preferences

1. Open Preferences.
2. Click **Reset Preferences** at the bottom left of the dialog. Every setting on every page returns to its default in the dialog.
3. Click **OK** to apply the defaults, or **Cancel** to keep your settings.

![The Reset Preferences button at the bottom left of the Preferences dialog, with its tool tip "Restore every preference to its default (applied on OK)"](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/preferences-reset-button.webp)

Reset Preferences also resets the Eyedropper Options, the Pathfinder Options, the Snap to Glyph options and the Perspective Grid Options. It does not change **Enable Contextual Task Bar**, **Snap to Grid** or **Smart Guides**. Your saved presets and libraries, such as PDF presets, print presets, gradient presets, saved color themes and document presets, are kept. With a document open, the reset sets the document's units to points, because **General** on the Units page returns to Points.
