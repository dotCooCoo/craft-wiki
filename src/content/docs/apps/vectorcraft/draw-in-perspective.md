This guide covers the perspective grid: the **View → Perspective Grid** commands, the Perspective Grid tool that adjusts the grid, drawing on the grid's planes, the Perspective Selection tool that moves art along them, the **Object → Perspective** commands and grid presets.

Shortcuts are written for Windows and Linux first, then macOS. You can change these keys in **Edit → Keyboard Shortcuts…**.

| Command or tool | Windows and Linux | macOS |
|---|---|---|
| View → Perspective Grid → Show Grid | Ctrl+Shift+I | Cmd+Shift+I |
| Perspective Grid tool | Shift+P | Shift+P |
| Perspective Selection tool | Shift+V | Shift+V |
| Left plane, horizontal plane, right plane, no plane (while the grid shows) | 1, 2, 3, 4 | 1, 2, 3, 4 |

The Perspective Grid and Perspective Selection tools share a group that the default toolbar does not show. Press their keys, or choose **Window → Toolbars → Advanced** to show every tool group.

## Show the grid and choose a preset

1. Choose **View → Perspective Grid → Show Grid** (**Ctrl+Shift+I**, or **Cmd+Shift+I** on macOS). A new document shows the **[2P-Normal View]** grid, fitted to the first artboard. While the grid shows, the menu item reads **Hide Grid**.
2. To start from another grid, choose one from **View → Perspective Grid → One Point Perspective**, **Two Point Perspective** or **Three Point Perspective**:

   | Submenu | Presets |
   |---|---|
   | **One Point Perspective** | **[1P-Normal View]**, **[1P-Low View]**, **[1P-High View]** |
   | **Two Point Perspective** | **[2P-Normal View]**, **[2P-Low View]**, **[2P-High View]** |
   | **Three Point Perspective** | **[3P-Normal View]**, **[3P-Low View]** |

   The Low and High views place the horizon lower or higher on the artboard than the Normal view does. Your own presets of each type are listed below the built-in ones.
3. Set the grid's view options in the same menu. These options are not undo steps.

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Show Rulers** | Shows a ruler up the line where the planes meet, in the grid's units at its scale. It is off by default |
| **Snap to Grid** | Art you draw or move in perspective lands on a gridline when it comes within a quarter of a grid cell. It is on by default |
| **Lock Grid** | Stops the grid's handles from being dragged. The plane switching widget still works |
| **Lock Station Point** | Dragging one vanishing point moves the other one with it, around the viewer's position. It works on two- and three-point grids |

Choosing a preset keeps art that is already on the grid attached, and keeps these four options as they were.

## Adjust the grid with the Perspective Grid tool

Press **Shift+P** for the Perspective Grid tool. If the grid is hidden, the tool shows it. Drag the grid's handles:

| Handle | Where it is | What a drag does |
|---|---|---|
| Vanishing points | On the horizon where each wall's lines meet, and above the grid in three-point perspective | Moves the vanishing point. The horizon moves with it; hold **Shift** to keep the horizon where it is |
| Horizon | On the horizon line, above the corner where the planes meet | Raises or lowers the horizon |
| Origin | The corner where the planes meet, at ground level | Moves the corner. Hold **Shift** to keep the move horizontal or vertical |
| Ground-level points | On each wall's base, next to the origin | Moves the whole grid. Hold **Shift** to keep the move horizontal or vertical |
| Wall ends | At the far end of each wall's base | Makes that wall longer or shorter. Hold **Alt** (**Option** on macOS) to change both walls, and **Shift** to move by whole grid cells |
| Wall height | At the top of the line where the planes meet | Makes the walls taller or shorter. Hold **Shift** to move by whole grid cells |
| Grid cell size | On the line where the planes meet, a few cells up from the origin | Changes the space between gridlines |

Press **Esc** before you release the mouse button to put the grid back as it was. Art already on the grid stays where it is when you change the grid.

Double-click the tool's button in the toolbar to open **Perspective Grid Options**. **Show Active Plane Widget** turns the plane switching widget on or off, and **Widget Position** puts it in the **Top Left** (the default), **Top Right**, **Bottom Left** or **Bottom Right** corner of the document window.

## Define a grid by values

Choose **View → Perspective Grid → Define Grid…** to set the grid by numbers. Clicking **OK** applies the changes as one undo step.

![The Define Perspective Grid dialog over the street corner, set to the [2P-Normal View] preset: Two Point Perspective, Points, scale 1:1, a gridline every 53 pt, Viewing Angle 45°, Viewing Distance 768 pt and Horizon Height 360 pt, with the Third Vanishing Point fields dimmed. The left, right and horizontal grid colors are blue, orange and green at 50% opacity, and the street corner shows around the dialog](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/define-perspective-grid.webp)

| Option | What it sets |
|---|---|
| **Preset** | Loads a preset's values into the dialog. It reads **[Custom]** once the values differ from every preset. **Save Preset…** saves the values as a new preset |
| **Type** | **One Point Perspective**, **Two Point Perspective** or **Three Point Perspective** |
| **Units** | The unit the lengths below are in. Every document unit except **Feet & Inches** is available |
| **Scale** | **1:1**, **1:2**, **1:4**, **1:8**, **1:12**, **1:24**, **1:48**, **1:96**, **1:100** or **Custom**, which adds **Artboard** and **Real World** fields. The lengths below are real-world lengths at this scale |
| **Gridline every** | The space between gridlines |
| **Viewing Angle** | Where the viewer stands between the two vanishing points, from 0° to 90°. The built-in presets use 45°. Only two- and three-point grids use it |
| **Viewing Distance** | How far the viewer stands from the picture. A shorter distance foreshortens the planes more |
| **Horizon Height** | The height of the horizon above the ground |
| **Third Vanishing Point** | **X** and **Y** of the vertical vanishing point, measured from the center of vision, X to the right and Y up. Only three-point grids use it |
| **Left Grid**, **Right Grid**, **Horizontal Grid** | The color of each plane's gridlines as a hex value. The defaults are blue (#3366ff), orange (#ff8c1a) and green (#2eb84a) |
| **Opacity** | The opacity of the gridlines, from 0% to 100%. The default is 50% |

A new type, viewing angle or viewing distance moves the vanishing points around the viewer's position.

## Pick the active plane

New shapes and art you drag onto the grid go on the active plane. The grid has a left plane, a right plane and a horizontal (ground) plane.

- Click a face of the plane switching widget, the small cube in the corner of the document window, with the Perspective Grid or Perspective Selection tool. The left face picks the left plane, the top face picks the horizontal plane and the right face picks the right plane. Click the dot beside the cube to work with no active plane.
- While the grid shows, press **1** for the left plane, **2** for the horizontal plane, **3** for the right plane or **4** for no plane.
- With the Perspective Selection tool, click an object that is on the grid. Its plane becomes the active plane.

Each plane also has a diamond-shaped widget on the grid, in the plane's color. With either perspective tool, drag a plane's diamond to move that plane forward or back. Hold **Shift** to move the art on the plane with it, or **Alt** (**Option** on macOS) to move copies of that art. Double-click the diamond to open the plane's dialog (**Left Plane**, **Right Plane** or **Horizontal Plane**). Type a **Location** and choose **Do Not Move**, **Move All Objects** or **Copy All Objects**.

## Draw on a plane

1. Show the grid and pick the active plane.
2. Choose the Rectangle, Rounded Rectangle, Ellipse, Polygon, Star, Line Segment, Arc, Spiral, Rectangular Grid, Polar Grid or Flare tool.
3. Drag on the canvas. The shape is drawn on the active plane, foreshortened toward its vanishing point. With **Snap to Grid** on, its corners snap to gridlines within a quarter of a cell.
4. To draw at an exact size, click once and type the size in the tool's dialog. The shape keeps that size measured along the plane, starting where you clicked.

With no active plane (press **4**), the shape tools draw flat shapes.

## Move and copy art along a plane

Press **Shift+V** for the Perspective Selection tool, then drag art that is on the grid.

| Action | Result |
|---|---|
| Drag | Moves the art along its plane |
| **Alt**-drag (**Option**-drag on macOS) | Moves a copy and leaves the original in place |
| **Shift**-drag | Keeps the move along the plane's lines or at 45° to them |
| Press **5** while dragging | Moves the art forward or back, at right angles to its plane. Press **5** again to slide along the plane |
| Press **1**, **2** or **3** while dragging flat art | Picks the plane the art goes onto |
| Drag a handle of the bounding box | Scales the art in perspective. Hold **Shift** to keep its proportions, or **Alt** (**Option** on macOS) to scale from the center |
| Arrow keys | Nudge the selection along its plane by the Keyboard Increment preference. **Shift** nudges 10 times as far, and **Alt** (**Option** on macOS) nudges a copy |

Press **Esc** before you release the mouse button to cancel a move or a scale. While you drag, a label shows how far the art moved along the plane (**dX** and **dY**), or **dZ** when it moves at right angles to the plane. **Object → Perspective → Move Plane to Match Object** moves the selected object's plane to where the object is and makes it the active plane.

## Put flat art and type on a plane

You can draw art and type flat and then put them on the grid.

1. Pick the active plane.
2. Choose one of these:
   - With the Perspective Selection tool, drag the flat art. It goes onto the active plane as soon as the drag starts and then moves along it.
   - Select the art and choose **Object → Perspective → Attach to Active Plane**. The art takes the plane's perspective, with the corners of its bounding box where they were.

Type and symbols on a plane stay type and symbols. To change the words of type on a plane:

1. Select the type and choose **Object → Perspective → Edit Text**, or double-click the type with the Perspective Selection tool. The type is shown flat in isolation mode, and you edit it with the Type tool.
2. Press **Esc**, or exit isolation mode, to put the type back in perspective.

The rest of the street corner is dimmed, the bar above the canvas shows Sign and LANTERNS, and the status bar reads Esc to exit editing](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/perspective-edit-text.webp)

VectorCraft does not put art on a plane if part of it would cross the plane's horizon.

## Release art from the grid

Select the art and choose **Object → Perspective → Release with Perspective**. The art keeps the shape it has on the page and is no longer attached to a plane.

## Save grid presets

- To save the current grid, choose **View → Perspective Grid → Save Grid as Preset…**. Type a **Name** (the default is **Perspective Preset 1**, then 2, and so on) and click **OK**. In **Define Grid…**, **Save Preset…** does the same with the values in the dialog.
- To manage presets, choose **Edit → Perspective Grid Presets…**. The dialog lists every preset and shows the selected preset's settings.

![The Perspective Grid Presets dialog listing the built-in views and two saved presets, Street Corner and Rooftop Low, with Street Corner selected. Its settings read Two Point, Points, 1:1, a gridline every 53 pt, a 45.0° viewing angle, a 768 pt viewing distance, a 360 pt horizon height and 50% opacity, above the New…, Edit…, Delete, Import… and Export… buttons](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/perspective-grid-presets.webp)

| Button | What it does |
|---|---|
| **New…** | Opens a new preset that starts from the selected one |
| **Edit…** | Changes the selected preset |
| **Delete** | Deletes the selected preset |
| **Import…** | Adds the presets in a `.vcperspective` file. An imported preset whose name is taken gets a number |
| **Export…** | Saves the selected preset to a `.vcperspective` file |

The built-in presets cannot be edited or deleted. To start from one, select it and click **New…**. VectorCraft keeps your presets with its preferences, and every document can use them.
