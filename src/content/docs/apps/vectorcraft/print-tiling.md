Tiled printing spreads a drawing that is bigger than your paper across several sheets of A4, Letter or any other size. VectorCraft divides the drawing into numbered tiles at the scale you choose. An overlap repeats a strip of the drawing on neighboring sheets, so you can line them up when you stick them together.

## Print a poster on several sheets

1. Open your drawing. For a full-size pattern, check that the drawing is the size you want before you print.
2. Choose **File → Print…** (**Ctrl+P**, or **Cmd+P** on macOS). In **Printer**, choose your printer, or **PDF File** to save the tiled pages as a PDF.
3. In **General**, under **Artboards**, choose **All**, or **Range:** to pick the artboards to print.
4. Under **Media**, set **Size** to the paper in your printer, or choose **Custom** and enter its width and height.
5. In **Advanced**, set **Unprintable margin** to allow for the edges your printer can't print on. VectorCraft uses one value for all four edges, and doesn't read it from the printer.
6. Back in **General**, under **Options**, set **Scaling** to **Tile Imageable Areas** or **Tile Full Pages** (see below). Set **Scale** to `100%` in both boxes to keep the drawing's real size.
7. Set **Overlap**, for example `10 mm`, to give yourself room to line the sheets up.
8. Use the arrows under the preview to look through the sheets. Check **Summary** for warnings.
9. Leave **Tile Range** empty to print every tile, or enter a range such as `1-3, 5`.
10. Choose **Print**. **Done** keeps the settings with the document without printing.

:::note
Print to **PDF File** first and check the pages. When you print that PDF, turn off any "fit to page" option in your PDF viewer, or the sheets come out too small. For a sewing pattern, measure a known length on a printed sheet before you print the whole job.

## Check the size first

At a **Scale** of `100%`, each inch of the artboard prints as an inch on paper. Check the artboard's size before you print.

1. Choose **File → Document Setup…** and check **Units**. The Print dialog shows **Overlap** and **Unprintable margin** in these units.
2. Open **Artboard Options** for the artboard: with the Artboard tool, double-click an empty part of the artboard, or choose **Artboard Options…** in the **Window → Artboards** panel menu.
3. Check **Width** and **Height**. For example, a 24 × 36 in poster prints on 12 Letter sheets with **Tile Imageable Areas**, a **Scale** of `100%`, a `10 mm` overlap and no unprintable margin.

[Set up a document and artboards](/apps/vectorcraft/set-up-documents-and-artboards/) covers units and artboard sizes in full.

## Choose a tiling mode

| Scaling | How it divides the drawing | Use it when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Tile Imageable Areas** | Each tile is the part of the paper inside the **Unprintable margin** | Your printer can't print to the edge of the paper. This is the safer choice |
| **Tile Full Pages** | Each tile is the whole sheet | Your printer prints borderless. Otherwise, art near the edges of each sheet may be lost unless the overlap covers it |

With **Unprintable margin** set to zero, both modes make the same tiles. **Fit to Page** shrinks the whole artboard onto one sheet instead.

## Tiling options

The tiling options are in the **General** section of the Print dialog, under **Options**, except **Unprintable margin**, which is in the **Advanced** section under **Printer**. **Overlap** and **Tile Range** can be set only while **Scaling** is a tile mode.

| Option | Section | What it sets | Default | Range |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Scaling** | General | How the art is sized on the paper: **Do Not Scale**, **Fit to Page**, **Custom Scale**, **Tile Full Pages** or **Tile Imageable Areas** | Do Not Scale | One of the five choices |
| **Scale** (**W** and **H**) | General | The printed width and height as a percentage of the art's size, with **Custom Scale** and the tile modes | 100% | 1% to 1000% |
| **Overlap** | General | How much art neighboring tiles repeat | 0 | 0 to 720 pt (10 in), and less than half the shorter side of a tile |
| **Tile Range** | General | The tiles that print, for example `1-3, 5` | Empty (every tile) | Tile numbers from 1 to the number of tiles |
| **Unprintable margin** | Advanced | The edge of the paper the printer can't reach, the same on all four sides. The preview shows it as a dashed line | 0 | 0 to 144 pt (2 in) |

**Overlap** and **Unprintable margin** show lengths in the document's units. You can type another unit, for example `10 mm`, and VectorCraft converts it. One artboard can print on at most 1,000 tiles, and one job on at most 2,000 pages.

## See the tiles on the canvas

**View → Show Print Tiling** shows each sheet's edges and numbers on the canvas, and the **Print Tiling Tool** moves the grid of sheets.

1. Choose **View → Show Print Tiling**. Each sheet shows the edge of the paper as a line, its printable area as a dashed line, and its tile number in the top-left corner. Tiles outside **Tile Range** are dimmer. The menu item changes to **View → Hide Print Tiling** while the tiles show.
2. Choose the **Print Tiling Tool**. To find it, press and hold the **Hand Tool** button in the toolbar. The tiles show while the tool is active, even with **Show Print Tiling** off.
3. Drag on the canvas. The pointer sets the top-left corner of the first sheet's printable area, and it snaps to the edges of the artboard. When **Measurement Labels** is on in the [Smart Guides preferences](/apps/vectorcraft/preferences/#smart-guides), a readout shows how far that corner is from the artboard's top-left corner. **Measurement Labels** is on by default.
4. Release the mouse button to place the grid. To cancel the drag, press **Esc** before you release.
5. To put the grid back at the top-left corner of the artboard, outside any bleed and marks, double-click on the canvas with the tool, or double-click the tool's button in the toolbar.

The Print Tiling Tool is part way through a drag that moves the grid up and to the left, with a readout of dX -0.50 in and dY -0.75 in at the first sheet's corner](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/poster-tiling-tool.webp)

The grid position is saved with the print settings. While **Scaling** is a tile mode, **Placement** in the Print dialog is grayed out. After the tool places the sheets, the **General** section shows the note "The Print Tiling tool placed the pages." with a **Reset** button. **Reset** puts the grid back at the top-left corner of the artboard, outside any bleed and marks. When **Scaling** is not a tile mode, **Reset** also makes **Placement** available again.

## Add trim marks to line up the sheets

1. In the Print dialog, open the **Marks and Bleed** section.
2. Turn on **Trim marks**. The marks print outside the corners of the artboard, on the corner sheets, and show where to cut the joined poster.
3. To number the sheets, also turn on **Page information**. It prints the file name, the artboard and the date below the artboard and adds the tile number, for example `tile 11 of 12`. It appears on the sheets along the bottom of the poster.

The tiles cover the artboard together with its bleed and marks, so turning on marks can add a row or column of sheets. Check the page count under the preview. [Print your artwork](/apps/vectorcraft/print-your-artwork/) describes the mark types, weights and offsets.

## Reprint one sheet

Tiles are numbered from 1, across each row from left to right, then down. In a grid of three columns and two rows, the top row is `1, 2, 3` and the bottom row is `4, 5, 6`. To reprint a damaged sheet, enter its number in **Tile Range**. Numbering starts again on each artboard.

Changing the paper, scale, margin, overlap or grid position can change the numbering, so check the preview again before you reprint.

## Put the sheets together

Lay the sheets out in order. Line up the repeated artwork in the overlaps, trim the unprinted edges if you need to, and tape or glue the sheets together. Print two neighboring tiles first to check the scale and overlap before you print a large job.

## Save the setup for next time

- Choose **Done** to keep the settings with the document without printing. When you save the document, the settings and the grid position are saved in the file, and the Print dialog opens with them next time.
- To use the same tiling for other documents, choose **Save Preset…** next to **Print Preset**, type a name in **Save as preset:** and choose **Save**. Pick the preset in **Print Preset** the next time you print.
- To add, change, delete, import or export presets without opening the Print dialog, choose **Edit → Print Presets…**.

## If something goes wrong

- **The drawing shrinks onto one sheet**: **Scaling** is set to **Fit to Page**. Choose a tile mode, and check both **Scale** boxes.
- **Art is missing along the edges of sheets**: use **Tile Imageable Areas** with a larger **Unprintable margin**, or a bigger **Overlap**.
- **No tiles show on the canvas**: choose **Done** in the **Print** dialog to keep the settings, then turn on **View → Show Print Tiling**. If the settings aren't valid, no tiles show; check **Summary** in the **Print** dialog.
- **Summary reports an error about the overlap**: **Overlap** must be less than half the shorter side of a tile. Enter a smaller value.
- **Too many or too few pages**: check **Artboards**, **Tile Range** and **Copies**. Under **Output**, use **Composite** for an ordinary poster.

In the web version, printing goes through the browser's print dialog, and **PDF File** downloads the PDF.
