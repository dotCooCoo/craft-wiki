This page lists common problems with VectorCraft and how to fix them. It also shows how to recover unsaved work, go back to the default settings, and find the version and the log to attach to a bug report.

## The window doesn't open, or stays black

On a computer with two graphics processors, such as many laptops, VectorCraft picks one for you. If the one it picked can't show the window, VectorCraft starts again on the next one by itself.

To choose the graphics processor yourself:

1. Choose **Edit → Preferences…** (**Ctrl+K**), then click the **Performance** page. On macOS, choose **VectorCraft → Settings → Performance…**.
2. Set **Graphics Processor** to **Power Saving (integrated)** or **High Performance (discrete)**. **Automatic** goes back to the default.
3. Restart VectorCraft. The change takes effect the next time VectorCraft starts.

If VectorCraft doesn't get far enough to open Preferences, choose the graphics processor when you start it. For example, in PowerShell, from the folder that contains `vectorcraft.exe`:

```powershell
$env:WGPU_POWER_PREF = "high"     # or "low" for the integrated one
& .\vectorcraft.exe
Remove-Item Env:WGPU_POWER_PREF   # go back to the default for later launches
```

On Linux or macOS, start it with `WGPU_POWER_PREF=high vectorcraft`. You can also set `WGPU_ADAPTER_NAME` to part of the graphics card's name, such as `nvidia` or `intel`. The [log](#find-the-log) lists the graphics processors VectorCraft found and the one it used.

## Files can't be dragged into the window on Linux

On a Wayland desktop, dropping files on VectorCraft's window doesn't work yet. Use **File → Open** or **File → Place**, or copy the file in your file manager and paste it into the document.

To drag files in:

1. Choose **Edit → Preferences…** (**Ctrl+K**), then click the **Performance** page.
2. Set **Linux Display Server** to **X11 (XWayland)**.
3. Restart VectorCraft.

## A drawing tablet's pen does nothing on Linux

On Wayland, under KDE Plasma 6.3 or later and under GNOME, VectorCraft can't get a pen's input yet. If the pen is plugged in when VectorCraft starts, VectorCraft opens its window through XWayland instead, where the pen works and its pressure is read.

If you plug the pen in later, choose **Edit → Preferences…** (**Ctrl+K**), click the **Performance** page, set **Linux Display Server** to **X11 (XWayland)**, and restart VectorCraft.

To keep the window on Wayland while a pen is plugged in, start VectorCraft with `VECTORCRAFT_NATIVE_WAYLAND=1`:

```sh
VECTORCRAFT_NATIVE_WAYLAND=1 vectorcraft
```

The pen then moves the pointer but does not draw. While **Linux Display Server** is set to **X11 (XWayland)**, VectorCraft ignores `VECTORCRAFT_NATIVE_WAYLAND` and opens the window through XWayland.

## The macOS menu bar shows no VectorCraft menus

On macOS, VectorCraft puts its menus in the menu bar at the top of the screen. If they don't show there, you can keep the menus inside VectorCraft's window instead:

1. Quit VectorCraft.
2. In Terminal, start it with the `--in-window-menus` option:

   ```sh
   /Applications/VectorCraft.app/Contents/MacOS/VectorCraft --in-window-menus
   ```

The menus then show in a bar at the top of the window. To start VectorCraft this way every time from Terminal, set `VECTORCRAFT_IN_WINDOW_MENUS=1` instead of passing the option.

## A menu item is grayed out

Some items are listed but not built yet. Others only work when something is selected, or when the right kind of object is selected. If you can't find a command at all, choose **Help → Search Commands…**.

## A file doesn't look as it does in another app

VectorCraft is in alpha, and some things don't come across between apps:

- **`.ai` files**: VectorCraft reads the PDF part that most `.ai` files contain, and older `.ai` files too. It saves `.ai` files in the same PDF-compatible form, without another app's own editing data, so some things may not be editable when the file is opened elsewhere.
- **Affinity documents**: whatever VectorCraft couldn't bring in, such as adjustments, blurs and brushes, is listed in a warning when the file opens. VectorCraft can't save Affinity files.
- **Photoshop files** open as one flattened picture, without their layers.

[Open and save files](/apps/vectorcraft/open-and-save-files/) lists what VectorCraft opens and saves in each format. If you need an exact copy, keep the original file. Please [report the file](https://github.com/storytold/vectorcraft/issues) if you can share it: real files are how we find these problems.

## Text shows in the wrong font

When a document uses fonts that aren't installed, the text shows in another font. In the desktop app, the **Missing Fonts** dialog opens after the document opens and lists each missing font. In the web version, no dialog opens; the status line shows how many fonts are missing.

1. Click **Search Fonts Folder** to search the `Fonts` folder next to the document, or **Find in Folder…** to search a folder you pick and its subfolders. **Search Fonts Folder** appears only when that folder exists, and **Find in Folder…** appears only where VectorCraft can ask you for a folder.
2. Check the font files you want to add, and click **Add Fonts**. VectorCraft copies them into its own Fonts folder and redraws the text.
3. To use another font instead, click **Find Fonts**. It opens **Type → Find Font…** with the first missing font selected.

[Add or replace missing fonts](/apps/vectorcraft/open-and-save-files/#add-or-replace-missing-fonts) describes each button.

## Placed images are missing

When a document opens and VectorCraft can't find a linked image file, the **Linked File Not Found** dialog asks about one file at a time. Until you relink it, the image shows the preview saved with the document.

1. When more files are missing, turn on **Apply to All** first. VectorCraft then looks for the others by name in the folder of the file you pick, or ignores them all when you click **Ignore**. The checkbox label shows how many more files are missing.
2. Click **Replace…** to pick the file, or **Find in Folder…** to search a folder and its subfolders for every missing file. **Ignore** leaves the image linked to the missing file.

To fix missing images later, choose **Window → Links**. A red badge with **?** marks each missing file. Choose **Select Missing** from the panel menu, then **Relink…** or **Relink to Folder…**. [Fix missing links when a document opens](/apps/vectorcraft/work-with-placed-images/#fix-missing-links-when-a-document-opens) has the details.

## VectorCraft closed and I lost my work

Open VectorCraft again. If it kept copies of unsaved documents, the **Recover Documents** dialog lists them with the time of each copy.

1. Click **Restore** to open them. Each one opens with **[Recovered]** after its name.
2. Save each restored document to keep it.

![The Recover Documents dialog over a dusk harbor poster titled Harbor Lights, listing Harbor Lights and Lighthouse Card with the time of each recovery copy, and the Discard, Cancel and Restore buttons](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/recover-documents.webp)

**Discard** deletes the copies. **Cancel** keeps them, and the dialog asks again the next time VectorCraft starts.

VectorCraft saves recovery copies of changed documents every two minutes by default. To change how often, or where they're kept, choose **Edit → Preferences…** (**Ctrl+K**), click the **File Handling** page, and look under **Data Recovery**. On macOS, choose **VectorCraft → Settings → File Handling…**.

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Automatically Save Recovery Data** | On | Keeps recovery copies of documents with unsaved changes. |
| **Every (minutes)** | 2 | How often VectorCraft saves the copies, from 1 to 60 minutes. |
| **Folder** | Empty | The folder for the copies. When it is empty, VectorCraft uses the `Data Recovery` folder in its settings folder. |
| **Turn off Data Recovery for complex documents** | Off | When on, VectorCraft keeps no copies of documents with more than 20,000 objects. |

## The web version is slow or won't start

The web version uses the graphics card through WebGPU, which browsers only allow on secure pages. Open it from an `https://` address, or from `localhost`. Over plain `http://` elsewhere it falls back to slower WebGL2 graphics, and the clipboard doesn't work.

## Start with default settings

If VectorCraft behaves oddly after you changed settings, put the preferences back to their defaults:

1. Choose **Edit → Preferences…** (**Ctrl+K**). On macOS, choose **VectorCraft → Settings → General…** (**Cmd+K**).
2. Click **Reset Preferences** at the bottom left of the dialog.
3. Click **OK** to apply the defaults, or **Cancel** to keep your settings.

Your saved presets and libraries are kept. [Reset Preferences](/apps/vectorcraft/preferences/#reset-preferences) lists what the reset changes.

To put the panels back, choose **Window → Workspace → Reset Essentials**. The item names the current workspace. See [Customize the workspace](/apps/vectorcraft/customize-the-workspace/).

To try VectorCraft once with the default settings without changing your saved ones, start it with `VECTORCRAFT_NO_PREFS=1`. VectorCraft then doesn't read or save its settings, keeps no recovery copies, and writes no log file.

```powershell
$env:VECTORCRAFT_NO_PREFS = "1"
& .\vectorcraft.exe
Remove-Item Env:VECTORCRAFT_NO_PREFS
```

On Linux or macOS, start it with `VECTORCRAFT_NO_PREFS=1 vectorcraft`.

## Find your version for a bug report

Choose **Help → About VectorCraft** (**VectorCraft → About VectorCraft** on macOS). The **About** tab shows the version number and, on its last line, the graphics processor VectorCraft draws with. Put both in your bug report.

![The About VectorCraft window over the Harbor at Dusk poster, on its About tab, showing Version 0.22.0, the Discord, ArtCraft website, getartcraft.com and GitHub links, the license and fonts line, and the graphics processor in use](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/about-vectorcraft.webp)

On Linux, `vectorcraft --version` prints the version. [Install and update](/apps/vectorcraft/install-update/) shows how to get a newer version.

## Find the log

VectorCraft writes a log you can attach to a bug report. It records the graphics processor it used, files it had trouble with, and errors it recovered from.

| System | Log folder |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\VectorCraft\logs\` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/VectorCraft/logs/` |
| Linux | `~/.config/vectorcraft/logs/` |

With the Windows portable zip, the log is in the `VectorCraftData\logs` folder next to `vectorcraft.exe`.

The current log is `vectorcraft.log`. The log from the run before is `vectorcraft.1.log`, so if VectorCraft crashed, attach that one too.

The folder above `logs` is VectorCraft's settings folder.
