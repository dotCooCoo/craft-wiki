VectorCraft comes with twelve plug-ins that add tools, panels and commands. This page lists what each one does and where to find it, and covers the plug-ins that no other guide describes.

## Find the plug-ins

Choose **Object → Plug-ins**. Each built-in plug-in has its own submenu:

| Submenu | What it adds | Covered in |
|---|---|---|
| **3D Box** | The 3D Box tool | [Draw boxes with the 3D Box tool](#draw-boxes-with-the-3d-box-tool) |
| **Arrange Tools** | Commands that lay out, swap, resize, group and sort objects | [Arrange objects](#arrange-objects) |
| **Artwork Cleanup** | The Artwork Cleanup panel, which finds and fixes problems, and commands that tidy paths and type | [Check and clean up a document](#check-and-clean-up-a-document) |
| **Color Effects** | The Color Effects panel, color effects and swatch commands | [Adjust colors](#adjust-colors) |
| **Compound Shapes** | Commands that make, release and expand compound shapes | [Make compound shapes](#make-compound-shapes) |
| **Contour** | The Contour tool | [Cut, join and refine paths](/apps/vectorcraft/cut-join-and-refine-paths/#outline-areas-with-the-contour-tool) |
| **Document Tools** | Commands that save, export and trace several files at once, and turn layers into symbols | [Work on many documents at once](#work-on-many-documents-at-once) |
| **Enclosing Lasso** | The Enclosing Lasso tool | [Select artwork](/apps/vectorcraft/select-artwork/#select-only-what-is-fully-inside-with-the-enclosing-lasso) |
| **Path Precision Tools** | Tools, panels and commands for anchor points, corners, crossings and dashes | [Cut, join and refine paths](/apps/vectorcraft/cut-join-and-refine-paths/) |
| **Selection Tools** | Select by Artboards… and commands that select images by link status | [Where the other plug-ins are covered](#where-the-other-plug-ins-are-covered) |
| **Smart Pen** | The Smart Pen tool and its panel | [Cut, join and refine paths](/apps/vectorcraft/cut-join-and-refine-paths/#draw-with-the-smart-pen) |
| **Type Tools** | Text Tweaker… and Release Type on a Path… | [Work with styles and long text](/apps/vectorcraft/work-with-styles-and-long-text/#tweak-single-letters-with-text-tweaker) |

![The Object menu is open on Plug-ins, which lists the twelve plug-in submenus from 3D Box to Type Tools, then No filter plug-ins installed, Install Plug-in… and Reload Plug-ins. The Arrange Tools submenu is open beside it with Swap Objects and Swap Objects and Sizes dimmed, over a night-violet sheet of selected star badges](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/plugins-menu.webp)

The plug-in tools (3D Box, Contour, Enclosing Lasso, Smart Pen and the Path Precision Tools) are not in the Tools panel at first, and none of them has a keyboard shortcut. Choose a tool from its submenu, or add it to the Tools panel from the All Tools drawer, as [Add the path plug-in tools to the Tools panel](/apps/vectorcraft/cut-join-and-refine-paths/#add-the-path-plug-in-tools-to-the-tools-panel) describes. To give a tool or command a shortcut, use **Edit → Keyboard Shortcuts…**.

Below the built-in submenus, **Object → Plug-ins** lists the filter plug-ins you have installed, or **No filter plug-ins installed** when there are none, then two commands:

- **Install Plug-in…** installs a plug-in from a `.wasm` file.
- **Reload Plug-ins** installs every `.wasm` file in the **Additional Plug-ins Folder** again.

To install all the plug-ins that a folder holds, set **Additional Plug-ins Folder** under **Plug-ins & Scratch Disks** in **Edit → Preferences…** (**VectorCraft → Settings → Plug-ins & Scratch Disks…** on macOS). When you install a plug-in that adds a live effect, VectorCraft adds **Effect → Plug-ins** and lists the effect there. To run commands from scripts and other programs instead, see [Automate VectorCraft](/apps/vectorcraft/automate-vectorcraft/).

## Arrange objects

Select the objects, then choose a command from **Object → Plug-ins → Arrange Tools**. Each command that changes the artwork is one undo step. The commands that end in **…** open a dialog that previews the result on the canvas while you change its values.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Arrange in Grid…** | Lays the objects out in rows and columns, in one row, or in one column |
| **Swap Objects** | Swaps the places of two selected objects. Select exactly two |
| **Swap Objects and Sizes** | Swaps the places, widths and heights of two selected objects |
| **Replace with Top Object…** | Puts a copy of the topmost selected object in place of each of the other selected objects. Each copy is centered on the object it replaces and takes that object's place in the stacking order |
| **Set Size of Each…** | Gives every selected object the same width, height or both |
| **Group Overlapping Objects** | Groups the objects whose bounds overlap or touch. When A overlaps B and B overlaps C, all three go in one group. Only objects in the same layer or group are grouped together |
| **Randomize Opacity…** | Gives each object its own opacity, picked at random between a minimum and a maximum |
| **Sort Objects…** | Sorts the objects by one attribute and gives them another in that order |
| **Zoom to Selection** | Zooms and scrolls the view so the selection fills the window |

**Arrange in Grid…** has these options:

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Layout:** | Sets the layout to **Grid by Row**, **Arrange by Row** or **Arrange by Column** |
| **Columns:** | Sets the number of columns, from 1 to 10,000. It is available only for **Grid by Row**. By default it is the square root of the number of objects, rounded up |
| **H Spacing:** and **V Spacing:** | Set the gaps between columns and between rows, from −1,000,000 pt to 1,000,000 pt. A negative gap makes the objects overlap. Both are 10 pt by default |
| **Center on Artboard** | Centers the grid on the artboard. When it is off, the grid starts at the top-left corner of the selection |

The objects go into the grid in their stacking order, from the back, left to right and top to bottom. Each column is as wide as its widest object, each row is as tall as its tallest object, and each object is centered in its cell.

![The Arrange in Grid dialog with Grid by Row, 4 columns, 12 pt H Spacing and V Spacing, and Preview selected. Beside it, twelve teal, coral, amber and plum badges on a night-blue sheet are selected and previewed in a grid of four columns and three rows](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/arrange-in-grid.webp)

In **Replace with Top Object…**, **Set Size of Each…** and **Sort Objects…**, **Scale Strokes & Effects** starts with the value of **Scale Strokes & Effects** under **General** in **Edit → Preferences…** (**VectorCraft → Settings → General…** on macOS), which is off by default.

**Replace with Top Object…** has these options:

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Size:** | Sets the size of each copy: **Actual Size** (the default), **Bounds**, which scales the copy to the replaced object's width and height, or **Bounds (Fit Proportionally)**, which scales it in proportion to fit inside them |
| **Keep Original** | Keeps the replaced objects under their copies. It is off by default |
| **Scale Strokes & Effects** | Scales the stroke widths and effects of the copies with them |

**Set Size of Each…** has these options:

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Width:** and **Height:** | Select one or both and type the size, from 0.001 pt to 1,000,000 pt. By default both are selected and show the size of the first selected object. **OK** is available only while at least one is selected |
| **Constrain Width and Height Proportions** | Scales the other side in proportion. It is available only when exactly one of **Width:** and **Height:** is selected, and it is off by default |
| **Reference Point** | Sets the point of each object that stays in place. It is the center by default |
| **Scale Strokes & Effects** | Scales the stroke widths and effects with the objects |

**Randomize Opacity…** has these options:

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Minimum:** and **Maximum:** | Set the range the opacities are picked from, from 0% to 100%. By default the range is 30% to 100%. **OK** is unavailable while **Minimum:** is above **Maximum:** |
| **Seed:** | Sets the starting number of the random picks, from 0 to 999,999. The same seed gives the same result. The dialog shows a new seed after each change to the document, so running the command again gives a different result |

![The Randomize Opacity dialog with Minimum: 30%, Maximum: 100%, Seed: 425 and Preview selected. Behind it, the selected badges on a night-blue sheet show different opacities, some faded and some solid](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/randomize-opacity-dialog.webp)

**Sort Objects…** sorts the objects by one attribute and gives them the values of another in that order. The first object in the order gets the smallest value. It has these options:

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Sort By:** | Sets the attribute that orders the objects: **Width**, **Height**, **Area**, **X Position** (the left edge), **Y Position** (the top edge), **Opacity** or **Stacking Order**. The default is **Area** |
| **Apply To:** | Sets the attribute the objects get in that order, from the same list. The default is **Stacking Order**, so the smallest object goes to the back |
| **Order:** | Sets the order to **Small to Large** (the default), **Large to Small** or **Random** |
| **Distribute Evenly** | Spaces the values evenly from the smallest to the largest, instead of trading the values the objects have. It is available when **Apply To:** is not **Stacking Order**, and it is off by default |
| **Scale Strokes & Effects** | Scales the stroke widths and effects with the objects. It is available only when **Apply To:** is **Width**, **Height** or **Area** |

The dialog opens with **Apply To:** set to **Stacking Order**, so **Distribute Evenly** and **Scale Strokes & Effects** are both dimmed at first.

![The Sort Objects dialog with Sort By: Area, Apply To: Y Position, Order: Small to Large, and Distribute Evenly and Preview selected. Behind it, the badges on a night-blue sheet are previewed with the smallest near the top and the largest near the bottom](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/sort-objects-dialog.webp)

## Check and clean up a document

**Object → Plug-ins → Artwork Cleanup → Document Health Check** opens the Artwork Cleanup panel.

1. Select the objects to check, or select nothing to check the whole document.
2. In the Artwork Cleanup panel, click **Check Selection** or **Check Document**. The panel lists each kind of problem it found with a count, or shows **No issues found.** The check leaves out locked and hidden objects, so unlock and show any objects you want it to check.
3. Click a row to pick it. **Ctrl**-click (**Cmd**-click on macOS) or Shift-click a row to add it to the picked rows, or to remove it.
4. Click **Show** to select the objects of the one picked row, **Fix Selected** to fix the picked rows, or **Fix All** to fix every row. Each fix is one undo step. The panel then checks again and shows **Issues fixed:** with the number of problems it fixed.

When you change the document after a check, the panel shows **Changed since the last check.** Click **Check Selection** or **Check Document** again to update the list.

**Object → Plug-ins → Artwork Cleanup → Fix All Issues** fixes every kind of problem without opening the panel. It fixes the selection, or the whole document when nothing is selected. It checks and fixes again, up to three rounds in all, while a round still finds problems, and the whole run is one undo step.

![The Artwork Cleanup panel docked at the top right after Check Document lists Empty Text 1, Stray Points 3 with that row picked, Unpainted Objects 1, Zero-Opacity Objects 1, Duplicate Objects 1 and Filled Open Paths 1, above the Show, Fix Selected and Fix All buttons and the Text section. On the canvas, a lit apartment block and a violet skyline stand against a sky that fades from violet to coral behind a setting sun, and three street lamps glow over a teal bush and a coral bench on the blue curb](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/health-check.webp)

The check looks for these problems:

| Problem | What the fix does |
|---|---|
| **Empty Text**, **Stray Points** (paths with one anchor point), **Unpainted Objects**, **Zero-Opacity Objects**, **Duplicate Objects**, **Off-Artboard Art** | Deletes the objects |
| **Duplicate Anchors**, **Nearly Coincident Anchors**, **Collinear Anchors** | Merges, snaps together or removes the anchor points |
| **Tiny Handles** | Retracts the handles |
| **Nearly Closed Paths**, **Filled Open Paths** | Closes the paths |
| **Needless Clipping Groups**, **Needless Compound Paths**, **Needless Groups** | Replaces each one with its contents |
| **Empty Artboards** | Deletes the artboards. The check looks for these only when it checks the whole document |

The panel and the submenu also run these commands on the selection:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Simplify Anchors (Keep Shape)…** | Removes the anchor points each path can do without and keeps its outline. **Tolerance** runs from 1 to 100 and is 20 by default. Select **Protect Corners** to keep the anchor points where the path turns by more than 30° |
| **Rejoin Path Pieces…** | Joins open paths whose ends lie within the **Gap** of each other. The gap is 0.1 pt by default and can be up to 6 pt |
| **Deep Ungroup…** | Ungroups every level of nested groups. Clipping groups stay as they are unless you select **Include Clip Groups** |
| **Combine Point Text** | Merges pieces of one-line point type whose baselines line up, keeping each letter in place |
| **Join Point Text** | Joins pieces of point type into one object, one paragraph per line |
| **Break Text into Lines**, **Paragraphs**, **Words** or **Glyphs** | Breaks each point or area type object into point type objects, each where its letters were |
| **Split Text at Cursor** | While you edit type with a Type tool, splits it into separate objects at the cursor or around the selected letters |
| **Set Alignment, Keep Position** | Sets point type to **Left**, **Center** or **Right** alignment without moving its longest line |
| **Reset Text Transform** | Removes the rotation, shear and reflection from point type. **Reset Text Transform and Scale** also removes horizontal scaling |
| **Remove Line Breaks**, **Remove Paragraph Breaks** | Removes forced line breaks or paragraph returns from the selected type |
| **Replace Missing Fonts…** | Sets every character in a font that is not installed to the font you choose. The font is Source Sans 3 by default |

In the panel, Shift-click **Lines** to break type into paragraphs, and **Alt**-click **Reset Transform** (**Option**-click on macOS) to remove horizontal scaling too. Click the **Text** heading to hide or show the text buttons.

## Adjust colors

**Object → Plug-ins → Color Effects** holds these commands:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Color Effects Panel** | Opens the Color Effects panel |
| **Exposure…**, **Desaturate**, **Duotone…**, **Invert Colors**, **Vector Halftone…** | Adds the effect to the selection as a live effect. **Effect → Color Effects** lists the same effects |
| **Print Ink Fixes…** | Prepares the inks of a CMYK document for print, as one undo step. See [Print Ink Fixes](#print-ink-fixes) |
| **Find Nearest Swatch…** | Lists the swatches closest to the selection's colors and gives the colors those swatches. See [Find Nearest Swatch](#find-nearest-swatch) |
| **Create Swatch Legend…** | Draws a chart of the document's swatches, one labeled square per swatch, as a group. See [Create Swatch Legend](#create-swatch-legend) |
| **Apply Fill to Stroke** | Gives each selected object's stroke the paint of its own fill |
| **Apply Stroke to Fill** | Gives each selected object's fill the paint of its own stroke |
| **Select by Color Kind** | Selects **Objects with Spot Colors**, **Objects with Color Effects**, **RGB Images**, **CMYK Images** or **Grayscale Images** |

In the Color Effects panel, choose an **Adjustment** (**Brightness/Contrast**, **Hue/Saturation**, **Levels**, **Temperature/Tint**, **Exposure**, **Desaturate** or **Invert Colors**) and set its values. Then click **Add as Effect** to add it as a live effect that you can edit later, or **Apply as Filter** to change the colors themselves. **Reset** returns the values to where they started. The **Inks** section opens **Duotone…** and **Print Ink Fixes…**.

![The Color Effects panel docked at the top right with Adjustment set to Hue/Saturation, Hue at -35 and Saturation at 25, above the Add as Effect, Apply as Filter and Reset buttons. On the canvas, the selected sky behind a corner café and a violet skyline has turned from violet to deep blue, and the Properties panel lists the Hue/Saturation effect](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/color-effects-panel.webp)

### Print Ink Fixes

**Print Ink Fixes…** works only in a CMYK document. In an RGB document it does not run and reports an error; choose **File → Document Color Mode → CMYK Color** first. It changes the selection, or the whole document when nothing is selected. The dialog has these options:

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Ink Limit** | Scales down each CMYK color whose total ink is above this percentage, from 1% to 400%. The default is 300%. Set it to 0 to leave the total ink as it is. Colors of spot swatches and Registration keep their ink |
| **Exclude Pure Black** | Leaves black-only and gray colors out of the ink limit. It is on by default |
| **Remove White Overprint** | Turns overprint off for white fills and strokes. It is on by default |
| **Overprint Black** | Sets black-only and gray fills and strokes with at least this percentage of black to overprint, from 1% to 100%. The default is 100%. Set it to 0 to leave overprint as it is |
| **Text Only** | Sets black overprint on type only. It is off by default |
| **Fill** and **Stroke** | Choose whether the fixes change fills, strokes or both. Both are on by default |

![The Print Ink Fixes dialog over a CMYK document of a corner café at dusk, with Ink Limit: 300 and Overprint Black: 100, and Exclude Pure Black, Remove White Overprint, Fill and Stroke selected. Text Only is cleared](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/print-ink-fixes-dialog.webp)

### Find Nearest Swatch

Select the objects first. In the **Find Nearest Swatch** dialog, choose a **Library:** (**Document Swatches** by default, or a color library or color book) and select **Fill**, **Stroke** or both (both by default). The dialog lists each color of the selection with its three closest swatches, closest first, and the ΔE difference of each. Click **Apply** to give each color its nearest swatch, as one undo step. A color that takes a global or spot swatch is linked to it, and a swatch from a library is added to the document's swatches first.

![The Find Nearest Swatch dialog with Library: Document Swatches and both Fill and Stroke selected. It lists each selected color with its closest swatches, such as R=59 G=130 B=246 with Bright Blue at ΔE 2.9, over a corner café where the lit shop front, a bench, a bush and the blue curb are selected](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/find-nearest-swatch-dialog.webp)

### Create Swatch Legend

The **Create Swatch Legend** dialog previews the legend on the canvas and has these options:

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Columns:** | Sets the number of chips in each row, from 1 to 50. The default is 4 |
| **Size:** | Sets the side of each square chip, from 8 pt to 1,000 pt. The default is 72 pt |
| **Gap:** | Sets the space between chips, from 0 pt to 1,000 pt. The default is 12 pt |
| **Show:** | Sets the color values each label shows: **HEX**, **RGB**, **CMYK**, **Lab** and **Grayscale**. When none is selected, as by default, each label shows the values of its swatch's own color model |
| **Selected Swatches Only** | Draws only the swatches selected in the Swatches panel. It shows only while some swatches are selected there |

Each chip is filled with its swatch and labeled inside with the swatch's name and values, in black on light chips and white on dark ones. The legend starts at the top-left corner of the first artboard, inset by the gap, and is selected when you click **OK**.

![The Create Swatch Legend dialog with Columns: 4, Size: 110 pt, Gap: 12 pt and Preview selected, over a dusk harbor poster at 150% zoom. At the top left of the artboard, the preview shows twelve chips from Night Ink to Mist Lavender, each labeled with its name and RGB values in white on dark chips and black on light ones, and the Swatches panel at the right holds the same colors](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/swatch-legend-preview.webp)

## Make compound shapes

A compound shape shows the combined area of its members, and you can still edit each member.

1. Select two or more objects.
2. Choose **Object → Plug-ins → Compound Shapes → Make Compound Shape**.

![A lavender cloud made of three circles and a rounded rectangle, joined into one compound shape over a dusk skyline. The outlines of its members show inside it, the Properties panel reads Compound Shape, and the Pathfinder panel is open above it](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/compound-shape-cloud.webp)

To get the members back as they were, choose **Release Compound Shape**. To turn the compound shape into one path or compound path, choose **Expand Compound Shape**.

**Shape Mode Buttons Make Compound Shapes** changes what the Shape Mode buttons in the Pathfinder panel do. When it is on, a click makes a compound shape and an **Alt**-click (**Option**-click on macOS) applies the Pathfinder operation permanently. When it is off, as it is by default, a click applies the operation permanently and an **Alt**-click makes a compound shape.

## Work on many documents at once

**Object → Plug-ins → Document Tools** holds these commands:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Save a Timestamped Copy** | Saves a copy of the document next to it, named with the date and time in UTC, such as `poster_2026-11-07_14-30.vectorcraft`. The open document keeps its file path, and its unsaved changes stay unsaved. For a document you have never saved, VectorCraft asks for a folder |
| **Export All Open Documents as PDF** | Asks for a folder and saves a PDF copy of every open document there, named after the document. A number is added to a name that is already taken, so no file is replaced |
| **Export All Open Documents as SVG** | Saves an SVG copy of every open document in the same way |
| **Batch Trace Folder** | Asks for a folder of images and then a folder for the results. It traces each PNG, JPEG, TIFF, BMP, GIF, WebP and PSD image with the **Default** preset and saves each result as a `.vectorcraft` file. It traces up to 500 images |
| **New Symbols from Layers** | Makes one symbol from each layer's art, named after the layer. When two or more layers are selected in the Layers panel, only those layers are used. Empty layers are skipped |
| **Convert Layers to Symbols** | Does the same and replaces each layer's art with an instance of its symbol. Locked layers are skipped |

![The Document Tools submenu of Object → Plug-ins, which lists Save a Timestamped Copy, Export All Open Documents as PDF, Export All Open Documents as SVG, Batch Trace Folder, New Symbols from Layers and Convert Layers to Symbols. Several documents are open in tabs behind the menu](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/document-tools-menu.webp)

The status bar reports how many files were written or traced. After an export, it also names the first document that could not be written. For tracing one image with your own settings, see [Trace an image](/apps/vectorcraft/trace-an-image/).

## Draw boxes with the 3D Box tool

1. Choose **Object → Plug-ins → 3D Box → 3D Box Tool**.
2. Drag on the canvas to draw the box. Hold Shift to draw it with equal width and height. Click without dragging to draw a box 100 pt wide and 100 pt high.
   - Hold Space while you drag to move the box.
3. While you drag, press ↑ or ↓ to rotate the box 5° around its X axis, or ← or → to rotate it 5° around its Y axis. Press Esc to cancel.

Amber, coral and teal crates drawn with the tool stand to the left, and the Control bar shows X: 30°, Y: 30°, Angle: 0° and the Reset button](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/3d-box-tool.webp)

While the tool is active, the Control bar (**Window → Control**) shows its settings:

| Setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| Shape buttons | Switch the tool between **3D Box**, **Rectangle**, **Ellipse**, **Polygon**, **Star** and **Spiral** |
| **X:**, **Y:** | Rotate the box around its X and Y axes, from −180° to 180°. Both are 30° by default |
| **Angle:** | Rotates the box in the plane of the page, from −180° to 180°. The default is 0° |
| **Link** buttons | Project the axis beside each button in parallel instead of in perspective while the button is on. By default only the button beside **Y:** is on |
| **Reset** | Returns the angles and the Link buttons to their defaults |

With a box selected, the Control bar shows that box's values, and changing them changes the box.
